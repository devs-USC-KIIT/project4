AI-Powered Smart Traffic Management 

# Background
Urban traffic congestion and frequent accidents result in economic losses and safety concerns. Current traffic management systems lack real-time adaptability.

# Problem Statement
Develop an AI-driven smart traffic management system that dynamically adjusts traffic signals, detects violations, and optimizes road safety using real-time data.

# Expected Solution
Computer vision-based traffic flow analysis to optimize signals
Violation detection (e.g., overspeeding, jumping red lights) using AI
Smart routing suggestions for emergency vehicles
Real-time traffic prediction models to reduce congestion
